#### Project Name-Outdoor air pollution monitoring in IIIT-H Campus


Given the data out of the already installed sensors inside the IIIT-H campus, we will be making a model which will help the user base visualize the air quality standards. Through the initial plan, we will be working to make a web portal which will consist of a heat map describing the pollution levels in the campus premises along with some statistical data. For this we will be given live data from the pre-installed sensors.
